# Learning – AI-Powered Study Assistant

## 📌 Overview
**Learning** is a mobile-first web application designed to make studying more effective and stress-free.  
Instead of spending hours creating study materials, students can automatically generate flashcards, practice them using spaced repetition, and track their progress — all in one place.

This project currently simulates AI-powered flashcard generation, but in production it can be integrated with the **OpenAI API** for real-time summarization and quiz creation.
